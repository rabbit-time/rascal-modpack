# Guide
A short guide introducing players to both the fundamentals and the intricacies of this modpack! All keybinds referenced in this guide refer to the modpack's defaults. This isn't comprehensive by any means. If you're interested, you can check out the [mod list](mod_list.md) yourself and see what each mod does!

## Basic mechanics
Many gameplay mechanics have been changed or added from the base vanilla experience. This section briefly explains the most important aspects.

### Backpacks
There are now backpacks which can be crafted and upgraded! You can equip one in the backpack slot and use `B` to open it.

### Cameras
Thanks to the exposure mod, realistic photography is now possible.

### Decoration
Plenty of new blocks and furniture to explore. Take a look at the recipe book and find yourself something nice!

### Farming
Farming has been overhauled and there is a cooking system!

### Inventory features
- Use the scroll wheel to move items
- Click the scroll wheel to sort
- Hold `shift+LMB` to move multiple items
- The recipe book button in the inventory is now useful! It will open EMI instead of the vanilla recipe menu. Alternatively, `CTRL+O` can also open EMI.

### Item physics
Dropped items now have physics! Each item can be picked up individually with `RMB`, or just sneak to pick a bunch of them up! The player can also throw items by holding the drop button. Items with a damage attribute will deal damage when thrown, such as swords or axes.

### Minimap
Use `M` to open your map at any time.

### Sleep
Craft a sleeping bag to sleep through the night without setting your spawn point. You can also craft a hammock to sleep through the day time until it is night!

### Tree harvesting
Trees will now be harvested when chopped while sneaking. All the logs will count towards your axe's durability and leaves will decay fast.

### Vanity armor
There are now vanity armor slots, just like in Terraria! The "familiar" armor set can also be crafted to simply show just your skin.

### Villager transport
Villagers will now follow you with `CTRL+RMB` while holding an emerald. They'll stop following you after a while, or you can end it early with `CTRL+RMB`, but without holding the emerald!
