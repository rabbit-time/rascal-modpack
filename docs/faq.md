# Frequently Asked Questions

### Can you add/remove this mod?
Please submit an [issue](https://github.com/rabbit-time/rascal-modpack/issues) explaining your proposed changes. It is not guaranteed that your changes will be implemented, but it will be properly considered.

### Will this modpack be available on Curseforge?
No. I'm not going to support Overwolf and you shouldn't either. It is an objectively worse platform than Modrinth and I don't care enough to go through the pain of supporting it.

### How can I edit mod configuration myself?
Most configurable mods in this mod pack will support Mod Menu, which can be accessed in the game's pause menu. Other mods may require manual configuration. Information on any mod can be found on its respective mod page.

This modpack was configured in a very careful and deliberate manner to deliver a stable and consistent gameplay experience. No guarantees can be provided about stability, balance, performance, or gameplay if the modpack is modified in any way.

### I'm having trouble running this modpack. How can I improve the performance?
None of the mods themselves are very intensive, except *maybe* for Terralith. You can still opt for vanilla world generation when creating a world or remove the mod entirely.

The only other resource-intensive part of this modpack is the included shaders along with its provided configuration. Feel free to edit, disable, or swap out the shaders if you prefer.

### My options reset every time I update my modpack. How can I keep my options?
You can do this by preserving your `options.txt` found in your modded instance directory and replace it when you migrate between modpack versions. However, keep in mind that you may need to configure your key binds for when new mods are added. In the future, it will be made easier to keep your options.

### Can I play on the same world between two versions of the modpack?
Yes, it should be fine for the most part. However, it is still highly advisable that you create a backup of your world before attempting to do so.
